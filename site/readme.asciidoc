== GSCV Web App

This is the repository for the temporary Sinatra web app version of Greg Borenstein's _Getting Started with Computer Vision_.

== Deploying to Heroku

Before deploying, merge in any new changes from the origin repo:

[source,bash]
----
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git merge upstream/master
----

Then on the command line, run the prep script and add/commit the changes to this repo:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./prep_to_deploy
$ git commit -am 'deploying latest version'
$ git push origin master
----

Then push to heroku:

[source,bash]
----
$ git push heroku master
----

This should be all you need to do.

== Running locally

To run the app locally, make sure you have shotgun installed. You'll want to merge in changes from the source repo and run the prep script. Then simply run:

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle install
$ shotgun
----

The app will now be running at http://localhost:9393/.

== Widgets

See https://github.com/oreillymedia/opencv-processing-book/tree/master/code for info about creating and implementing widgets.

== Quizzes

You can include interactive quizzes by placing HTML markup inline in your markdown files. We use Bootstrap popups to reveal the answer. Here are two examples of how you could structure this:

[source,html]
----
Q: What qualities of our input image could cause problems with brightness tracking: A) The presence of many glowing objects. B) Moving shadows cast by passersby. C) The auto-exposure on our camera triggering. D) All of the above.

<p class="pop btn bottom" href="#" rel="popover" title="Answer"
data-content="D, all of the above.">Reveal Answer</p>
----

Which will look like this:

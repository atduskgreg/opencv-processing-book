# Test Case 1: Film Scanner Frame Extractor

## Part 3: Applying Filters

We've been talking for awhile here without looking at any code. In this section, we're going to remedy that. We'll look at the basics of using OpenCV in Processing. We'll see how to load up an image, apply filters to it, and see the output.

Once you've got those basics down, we'll take another look at the filters introduced in the last section. This time, I'll show you the parameters for each one and explain what they do.

While you're reading keep this question in mind: how could use these filters (alone or in combination) to accentuate the frame borders, sprocket holes, and frame edges in our scan? There'll be a quiz at the end that asks you to do exactly that.

### Quiz: Filter for Frame Features

As we saw in the last section, the purpose of all of these filters is to bring out the parts of an image from which we can derive useful data. In the case of Kinograph, those parts are sprocket holes, the frame borders, and the frame edges.

In this quiz, your job is to apply what you just learned about these filter functions and their parameters to a Kinograph scan. You can use them individually or in combination. After you've applied your filters, we'll evaluate the results to see how much you've revealed each image feature. Keep trying until you get all three (either with a single combination of filters or in multiple tries).

== GSCV Web App

This is the repository for the temporary Sinatra web app version of Greg Borenstein's _Getting Started with Computer Vision_.

== Running locally

To run the app locally, make sure you have shotgun installed. Then simply run:

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle install
$ shotgun
----

The app will no be running at http://localhost:9393/.

== Deploying

Before deploying, merge in any new changes from the origin repo:

[source,bash]
----
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git merge upstream/master
----

Then on the command line, run the prep script and add/commit the changes to this repo:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./prep_to_deploy
$ git commit -am 'deploying latest version'
$ git push origin master
----

Then push to heroku:

[source,bash]
----
$ git push heroku master
----

This should be all you need to do.

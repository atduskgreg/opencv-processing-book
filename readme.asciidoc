== GSCV Web App

This is the repository for the temporary Sinatra web app version of Greg Borenstein's _Getting Started with Computer Vision_.

== Deploying to Heroku

Before deploying, merge in any new changes from the origin repo:

[source,bash]
----
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git merge upstream/master
----

Then on the command line, run the prep script and add/commit the changes to this repo:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./prep_to_deploy
$ git commit -am 'deploying latest version'
$ git push origin master
----

Then push to heroku:

[source,bash]
----
$ git push heroku master
----

This should be all you need to do.

== Running locally

To run the app locally, make sure you have shotgun installed. You'll want to merge in changes from the source repo and run the prep script. Then simply run:

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle install
$ shotgun
----

The app will now be running at http://localhost:9393/.
